A thorough and deliberate walk through on deploying your one page, static or serveless websites to netlify, even creating and deploying on your subdomains all for for the price of oxygen(free).<br>
First off, there a couple of things you should get sorted out. I suspect you already have an account with github or bitbucket, I'm really not sure of other vcs systems but gitlab should also work fine. It's important to understand how netlify works before you begin your adventure. Netlify, just like heroku and some other platforms is a cloud computing company that offers hosting of serverless web applications or static websites to be honest. Before I dive deeper, I am in no way paid to do this, It's just a recommendation of mine.

Netlify has a lot of advantages,especially for those of us that love free stuff.
