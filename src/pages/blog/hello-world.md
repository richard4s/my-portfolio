As is the case with almost everything I can imagine, a friendly introduction to my blog.
The truth is I have actually been postponing publishing of my blog for a while.
With everything happening right now just seems like the right time. So here you go, I try to do as much as I can while I can at least.
The developer journey really is very easy to trail off course, to something a just a bit more easier, something that won't really change you much, something seamlessly easy. 

I was just talking to a friend some days ago, then all of a sudden I asked him this question, "Have you ever had a day to rest since you wrote your first line of code?". He just startled at me and thought for a while, to just gave a big 'ol No, we laughed it off knowing fully well there are days we for real don't jam our keyboards in but on those days our conscience fills up with guilt of some project we're working on that's not yet complete or a cool javascript framework to learn. And it almost seems as if we should been given a warning before venturing off into this nocturnal lifestyle, I know I wish I had been told.

From the outside, it all feels really cool, build stuff people use, stuff you would waant to use yourself, someone could very well misinterpret it as plug and play. You just need to do this and that and boom! You've made the next Google or Facebook or Uber. Sorry to burst your bubbles, the little while I've spent smashing keyboards I've seen people lose it, their technology stack got outdated, the bugs were looking too scary, too much procedures, frameworks madness, personal life drama, or they just turn into that project manager that could have been a great dev, hard to say really which one it is I guess different people have different reasons. I digress a lot, you must have figured that about by now I intended to write a little introduction to my blog through this ironic `hello-world` title but there is a whole paragraph not related to it above, that's a heads-up that I shall I rant on this blog a lot, at my duscretion.

Ranting is life lol. But on the bright side I would be sharing my experiences along my development as a software guy lol and some coding practices and what not. The newsletter would come up later too chaw! üñê.
