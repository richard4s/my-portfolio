It pretty difficult to preserve personal relationships these days, everyone is always busy, people get caught up in work, school and a bunch of other flimsy excuses. But as you grow, it these personal relationships that count the most or so I've been told, I'm not there yet either.<br>

In every field, there are different people you come across that eventually turn out helping you, some hold your hands and walk you through much deeper learning like a baby, some give you tough love(the figure it out yourself guys), some just teach by doing. We all tend to look up to these kind of people, because they have in some way made us better than our previous selves.
