<br>
It pretty difficult to preserve personal relationships these days, everyone is always busy, people get caught up in work, school and a bunch of other flimsy excuses. But as you grow, it these personal relationships that count the most or so I've been told, I'm not there yet either.<br>

In every field, there are different people you come across that eventually turn out helping you, some hold your hands and walk you through much deeper learning like a baby, some give you tough love(the figure it out yourself guys), some just teach by doing. We all tend to look up to these kind of people, because they have in some way made us better than our previous selves. What you should know is that keeping in touch with these people is hugely beneficial, it might be quite difficult because these are the kind of people you wouldn't want to be disturbing all the time or that you can't even disturb all the time. But some level of consistency with your relationship with them should be maintained.

At times, you might still require help or just someone to talk to that understands.
