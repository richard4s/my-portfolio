<br>
Fresh out the bat after finally completing your new react project, you must be feeling pumped and ready to unleash your web app for the world to admire huh? That's fine, I guess. It's only the right thing to do. <br>

So you went against what everyone was saying about going serverless or you just really want to get all your project on your digitalocean droplet or for whatever reason you didn't use any of [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and the rest. You took the bold step of wanting to manage everything on your server. Stupid! You are going to get introduced to a new world of pain so get ready!

<h3>Your requirements:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Digitalocean droplet</li>
</ul>
